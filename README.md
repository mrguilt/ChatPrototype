Working another, more different [Swift tutorial, for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/hello-swiftui). This one looks like it's simulating an iOS app. I figure this will be in parallel to [TheBasics](https://github.com/mrguilt/TheBasics), as I'm doing my own exploration there. Since one of the reasons I pivoted from Rust to Swift was to create apps on my daily driver systems, I should play with XCode.
